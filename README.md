# Exploitation Docker

This is my master thesis project, a docker container with several userland exploitation techniques. 


The thesis title is "Development tools and process of zero day exploits".


## Techniques

- Vanilla buffer overflow with shellcode
- Return to .text
- Return to .bss  (ret2bss)
- Return to libc (ret2libc)
- Return to CSU (ret2csu)
- One gadget

In these techniques will be explained exploit mitigations and bypasses.

- Data Execution Prevention
- Stack Canary
- Address Space Layout Randomization
- RELRO

## Usage

build.sh will build the docker and you can use start.sh to start a console with the exploits directory as mounted volume.
